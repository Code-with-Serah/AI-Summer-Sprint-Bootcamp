# Fake News Detection Project

"We may not stop fake news, but we can expose it."

 Overview
This project aims to detect and classify news articles as **real** or **fake** using multiple machine learning models. The goal is to provide a robust pipeline capable of identifying misinformation and enhancing digital literacy.

Objectives
- Automatically classify news content based on its authenticity.
- Compare and evaluate the performance of different machine learning models.
- Build an interactive web app interface for real-time predictions using Streamlit.

Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
  - TF-IDF Vectorization
  - Text Preprocessing (stopwords removal, lemmatization, etc.)
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**
  - Logistic Regression (LR)
  - Decision Tree (DT)
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)
  - Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
- **Streamlit** â€“ For building the web application
- **Google Colab** â€“ For development and training

ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Fake News Dataset] True & Fake CSV
- **Description**: The dataset contains news articles labeled as FAKE or REAL, along with titles, texts, and subjects.
