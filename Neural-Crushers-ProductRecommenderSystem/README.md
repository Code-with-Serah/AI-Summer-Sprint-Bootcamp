## Project Overview
A machine learning-based product recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering and advanced ML techniques to provide personalized product suggestions to users.

## Project Files
- `main.py` - Main application entry point
- `ML_RecTraining.ipynb` - Machine learning model training notebook
- `lightfm_model.pkl` - Trained LightFM recommendation model
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Team Members
Neural Crushers

## Technology Stack
- Python
- LightFM (Collaborative Filtering)
- Machine Learning
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Recommendation Systems

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Explore the model training process in `ML_RecTraining.ipynb`
3. Run the main application: `python main.py`
4. The trained model (`lightfm_model.pkl`) will be loaded automatically

## Features
